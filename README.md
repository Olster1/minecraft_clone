# Minecraft clone

A minecraft clone for me to practice 3d games & see how close I can get it to the real minecraft.

Uses OpenGL 3.3 and SDL for platform layer.

## Goals

- [x] Block mining
- [x] Clouds & Sky 
- [x] Ambient Occulsion of blocks mult-threaded
- [x] Multi-threaded chunk generation
- [x] Tree & grasses generation
- [x] Water generation with alpha 
- [ ] Cows, Sheep & Zombie Mobs (learn about loading animation files with cgltf - Game Engine Architecture book)
- [ ] Attacking mobs 
- [ ] Health, Stamina & Item Hotbar
- [ ] Cave generation
- [ ] Coal & Ore generation & better world generation with snow and cliffs (learn more about simplex noise & SIMD library implementation of it)
- [ ] Day & Night cycle
- [ ] Greedy meshing
- [ ] Shadow Mapping
- [ ] Point & Directional lights
- [ ] Server side application to run on a Rasberry Pi 4 that accepts TCP (block transactions) & UDP (entity positions) packets using Berkely Sockets API (learn about writing a server and running it, and learn about cyber security concepts in practice)
- [ ] Release game on itch.io as professional as possible - just exe & asset bundle 

## WHY's
- [x] Fun & Challenging to program
- [x] Get as good as I can at programming
- [x] Add to my projects list
- [x] Build confidence
