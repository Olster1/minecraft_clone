# Minecraft clone

A minecraft clone for me to practice 3d games & see how close I can get it to the real minecraft.

Uses OpenGL 3.3 and SDL for platform layer.

## Building on Mac OS
run ```./run.sh``` to build and run the program. 

I haven't added any of the images so it won't run without them.
